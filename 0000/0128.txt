Iris: ...That one dragon Pokémon made a\xfffenew land together with twin heroes.\xf000븁\x0000And people and Pokémon lived\xfffetheir days happily!\xf000븁\x0000
Shaga: But one day...\xf000븁\x0000The older of the two heroes sought\xfffethe truth, and the younger sought\xf000븀\x0000the ideal.\xf000븁\x0000A dividing struggle began to\xfffedecide who was right...\xf000븁\x0000The single dragon that had walked\xfffewith the twins was also split\xf000븀\x0000into two to support both...\xf000븁\x0000

Iris: A light dragon that searched\xfffethrough the world of the past\xf000븀\x0000for the truth...\xf000븁\x0000Its name was Reshiram.\xf000븁\x0000And another...\xf000븁\x0000A dark dragon that searched through\xfffethe new, hopeful world\xf000븀\x0000for its ideal...\xf000븁\x0000Its name was Zekrom.\xf000븁\x0000

Shaga: The two being equal entities from\xfffethe very start only made the\xf000븀\x0000quarrel more violent.\xf000븁\x0000Whichever side won, they would end\xfffeup absolutely exhausted...\xf000븁\x0000The twin heroes, too, could not find\xfffeeither to be right in their\xf000븀\x0000struggle... So the struggle was ended...\xf000븁\x0000
Iris: And yet, yet, yet...\xfffethe hero's sons began to struggle\xf000븀\x0000again...\xf000븁\x0000So Reshiram and Zekrom used their\xfffelightning and flames to eradicate\xf000븀\x0000Isshu in an instant...\xf000븁\x0000But if people hadn't been mistaken about\xfffehow to get along with Pokémon, the\xf000븀\x0000world wouldn't have been destroyed!\xf000븁\x0000So Reshiram and Zekrom did their\xfffebest for everyone and made a\xf000븀\x0000new land!\xf000븁\x0000And so so so...!\xf000븁\x0000

Shaga: ...I'm certain Pokémon\xfffedon't need possessions.\xf000븁\x0000As people continue having their\xfffeown thoughts on Pokémon, some\xf000븀\x0000of them may be hateful...\xf000븁\x0000But even so!\xf000븁\x0000It is necessary for Pokémon and\xfffepeople to believe in each other\xf000븀\x0000to continue living...\xf000븁\x0000
Iris: Yow, that's right!!\xf000븁\x0000And so so sooo! We just CAN'T\xfffelet Team Plasma separate us\xf000븀\x000from our Pokémon!\xf000븁\x0000
Shaga: ...I'm sorry, that last\xfffepart was a bit off-topic.\xf000븁\x0000But that's all we can tell you.\xf000븁\x0000Unfortunately, we know nothing about\xfffehow to awaken the legendary dragon\xf000븀\x0000Pokémon...\xf000븁\x0000
Shaga: ...Well, I made a promise to Adeku.\xfffeYou'll have to come get the Souryuu gym badge.\xf000븁\x0000
Well then, Iris.\xf000븁\x0000How about you go face\xfffe\xf000Ā\x0001\x0000 at the gym?\xf000븁\x0000
Iris: YES!!\xf000븁\x0000Uncle Shaga has seen how strong\xfffeI am, and so will you!\xf000븁\x0000
Well then, \xf000Ā\x0001\x0000.\xf000븁\x0000I await your challenge at the\xfffePokémon gym!\xf000븁\x0000
Shaga: ...People and Pokémon\xfffeboth live in this world.\xf000븀\x0000What will come from\xfffetheir separation?\xf000븁\x0000The way we all coexist with each\xfffeother shouldn't be changed.\xf000븁\x0000I believe that this\xfffecoexistence is rich in value.
Iris: It's great when everyone can\xfffeget along, Pokémon and humans!
