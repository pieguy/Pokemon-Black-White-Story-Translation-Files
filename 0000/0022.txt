Welcome!\xfffeWelcome to the Shippou Museum!
Those thieves... What on earth\xfffeis "Team Plasma"?
The Pokémon Gym is\xfffein the back of the museum!
They took the dragon bone!\xfffeWhat are they planning to do with it?
Hmmm! Every time I see this skeleton...\xfffeit's simply charming!\xf000븁\x0000
Ah, hello. I'm the\xfffevice-curator, Kidachi.\xf000븁\x0000You've come a long way. \xfffeI'll show you around the building!\xf000븁\x0000
This skeleton...\xfffeIt's from a Dragon-type Pokémon.\xf000븁\x0000Perhaps there was some kind of\xfffedisaster while it still roamed\xf000븀\x0000the Earth, which caused it to\xf000븀\x0000fossilise like this.\xf000븁\x0000
This stone is amazing!\xfffeIt's a meteorite, in fact!\xf000븁\x0000There appears to be some kind of\xfffespace energy coming from it.\xf000븁\x0000
Aah... this is a\xfffeperfectly normal old stone.\xf000븁\x0000It was found in the desert, but\xfffeits age is probably its\xf000븀\x0000only valuable quality...\xf000븁\x0000It's very pretty, though, so\xfffewe display it here.\xf000븁\x0000
Past here is\xfffethe Shippou City Gym.\xf000븁\x0000
At the very back, you'll find the strong,\xfffekind Shippou Gym leader.\xf000븁\x0000Ah - I should mention that\xfffeGym Leader Aloe is my wife.\xf000븁\x0000
At the very back, you'll find the strong,\xfffekind Shippou Gym leader.\xf000븁\x0000Ah - I should mention that\xfffeGym Leader Aloe is my wife.\xf000븁\x0000
Aloe: Hold it, you lot!\xfffeStop messing around and give that back!\xf000븁\x0000
Team Plasma: Ah, you came, Gym Leader!\xf000븁\x0000We, Team Plasma, are\xfffetaking this dragon skull\xf000븁\x0000from your museum\xfffein the name of Pokémon liberation!\xf000븁\x0000
Team Plasma:\xfffeAnd just to prove we're serious,\xf000븀\x0000we'll do it before your very eyes!\xf000븁\x0000
Team Plasma: Here we go! SMOKESCREEN!\xf000븁\x0000
PLAAAAASMAAAAAA!
PLAAAAASMAAAAAA!
Aloe: What in the name of...?\xf000븁\x0000
Kidachi: A-Aah!\xfffeWe have to go after them!\xf000븁\x0000
Kidachi: That bone is\xfffeAloe's treasured possession...
Bel: Thieves on the loose?\xfffeI won't allow it!
Cheren: Because of Team Plasma's heist,\xfffeI can't fight the Gym Leader...\xf000븁\x0000That's so annoying.
The skeleton is\xfffetruly marvellous...\xf000븁\x0000Its functional, non-wasteful design\xfffeisn't apparent from its outward appearance.\xf000븁\x0000Its true essence can really\xfffeonly be described as... charming.
The cool, rare treasures of the world...\xfffeThe museum is jam-packed with romance.
Awawawawa！
The Gym Leader here\xfffealso researches fossils\xf000븀\x0000and Pokémon bones.
That daring heist\xfffeby the thieves...\xf000븁\x0000It seems that they believed\xfffethey were doing the right thing.
It might be that some Pokémon\xfffecame from space along with\xf000븀\x0000this meteorite.
What on earth are those\xfffeTeam Plasma people thinking?!
A skeleton of a Pokémon\xfffethat flew around the world.
We lost part of the skeleton -\xfffeTeam Plasma took it!
The fossil of a Pokémon\xfffethat was protected by a hard shell.
A meteorite that had a\xfffespace virus stuck inside.
A round rock from ancient times,\xfffefound in the desert.
Some stone slabs that have\xfffenot yet been deciphered.
A mask people wore for\xfffefestivals long ago.
A bone that a Pokémon\xfffecarried as a weapon.
